# algorithms-in-gis
This repository consists of some of the algorithms in GIS which were studied in the "Algorithms in GIS" course at Lund University.

Throughout the course Matlab were used. However, I performed the algorithms using Python. No high-level functions were allowed so they are all written from scratch.
